# Titanic Survival Prediction ðŸš¢
This project predicts the likelihood of passenger survival aboard the Titanic using machine learning techniques. Leveraging the well-known Titanic dataset, it demonstrates the application of data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and predictive modeling.

## Introduction
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous disasters in history. By analyzing a dataset of passengers' details, this project predicts who was more likely to survive based on factors such as age, gender, passenger class, and more.

This project is ideal for learning the end-to-end process of building a machine learning model.
